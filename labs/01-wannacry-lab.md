# Lab 01: WannaCry Ransomware Simulation

**Objective:** Understand how WannaCry spreads and mitigations.  

**Environment:** Virtual lab with Windows VM (patched/unpatched), SMBv1 enabled.  

**Steps:**  
1. Configure two Windows VMs on the same network.  
2. Enable SMBv1 on the target VM.  
3. Simulate WannaCry propagation (controlled environment).  
4. Observe how the worm spreads across network shares.  
5. Apply patches and disable SMBv1.  
6. Confirm propagation stops.  

**Learning Points:**  
- Patch management and disabling vulnerable services.  
- Importance of network segmentation and endpoint protection.
