# Lab 02: Web Application Vulnerability Assessment (Equifax Case)

**Objective:** Practice identifying unpatched web vulnerabilities.  

**Environment:** Web server VM with intentionally vulnerable Apache Struts.  

**Steps:**  
1. Scan server for vulnerabilities using tools (e.g., Nikto, Nmap).  
2. Identify Apache Struts CVE.  
3. Simulate patching the vulnerability.  
4. Test if exploit attempt still works.  

**Learning Points:**  
- Timely patching is critical.  
- Use automated tools to identify vulnerabilities.  
- Document and remediate promptly.
