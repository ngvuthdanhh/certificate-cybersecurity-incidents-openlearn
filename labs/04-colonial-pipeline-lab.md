# Lab 04: VPN Security & MFA Simulation

**Objective:** Learn the importance of MFA for critical infrastructure.  

**Environment:** Linux VPN server, two user accounts.  

**Steps:**  
1. Configure VPN server with username/password only.  
2. Attempt unauthorized access simulation.  
3. Enable MFA for all accounts.  
4. Attempt unauthorized access again; observe prevention.  

**Learning Points:**  
- MFA significantly reduces account compromise risk.  
- Proper network segmentation limits attack impact.  
- Cyber hygiene and monitoring are crucial.
